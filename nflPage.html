It hasn't been the smoothest of rides to this point -- he is playing through left knee pain and has thrown eight interceptions already on the year after being picked off just six times last season. But he has made a number of dazzling plays and tends to come up big in crucial moments, guiding the Eagles to the best record in football.</p>

He's tied for the league lead with eight interceptions -- which is on pace for 17 interceptions, and that would easily surpass the worst of his career (13). With 15 touchdown passes, Mahomes is on pace for a touchdown-to-interception ratio of less than 2-to-1, which would also be a career worst.

                                      <p class="card-text">Trevor Lawrence's stats might not be leading-the-league impressive -- 1,935 yards, 9 TDs, 4 INTs -- but he's playing consistently good football. He has had a passer rating of at least 90 or better in his past five games (a career-high streak) and has posted a passer rating of 90 or above in six of the team's eight games. He's still making some of those young quarterback mistakes, like his end zone interception on a ball he should have thrown away, and he tries to keep plays alive too long (a major reason for his six fumbles), but Doug Pederson has praised Lawrence's leadership, his toughness (he's playing on a sprained left knee) and the clutch throws and plays he has made during the Jaguars' 5-0 stretch in October.</p>

He's still dangerous with his legs, whether it's extending plays or delivering big gains on the ground. His 380 yards rushing tops all quarterbacks. Jackson's playmaking ability is why Baltimore is tied for the best record in the AFC and holds a 1½-game lead in the AFC North</p>

Goff has 2,174 passing yards and 12 touchdowns to five interceptions through the first eight games.

Allen has looked like an MVP candidate at times -- specifically, in a three-game stretch from Weeks 2 to 4, when he completed 76.6% of his passes and had eight touchdowns to one interception. At other times, Allen has looked out of sync, notably from Weeks 5 to 7 (65.8% completion percentage, six passing touchdowns to three interceptions). Allen and the Bills are making an effort to reduce hits, and against the Buccaneers last Thursday, Allen rushed seven times for 41 yards and a touchdown in an improved offensive </p>

                                      <p class="card-text">Dak Prescott has stepped up his play the past two games, and he has done more with his legs, not just with his running but buying time outside the pocket to make off-script plays. As he has gotten more comfortable with Mike McCarthy as the playcaller, he has been able to find his way in certain situations. Prescott has three games this year in which he has completed at least 80% of his passes, but some of that was due to quick, shorter throws. Against the Rams on Sunday, he was 7-of-9 for 133 yards and three touchdowns on passes of 10 or more air yards in the first half. When Prescott completes more than half of his throws of 10 yards or more, the Cowboys are 4-0 this year, per ESPN Stats & Information.</p>
